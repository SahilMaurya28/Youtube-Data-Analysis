# 🎥 YouTube Data Analysis using Python  

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project explores and analyzes YouTube video data to uncover key insights into audience engagement, content performance, and viewing trends.  
By examining relationships between **likes, comments, views, dislikes**, and **categories**, this analysis aims to understand what factors contribute most to audience engagement.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Measure and compare audience **engagement rates** across videos and categories.  
- Analyze the **correlation** between likes, views, comments, and dislikes.  
- Identify **top-performing categories** and channels based on engagement.  
- Visualize audience patterns and relationships through clear, data-driven charts.  

---

## 🧠 Key Insights  
- Engagement rate does **not always increase with view count** — smaller channels can have highly active audiences.  
- Strong **correlation** between likes and views suggests that quality engagement drives visibility.  
- Categories like *Education*, *Pets & Animals*, and *Science & Technology* often have **higher engagement rates** despite fewer overall views.  
- Most videos maintain a **high like-to-dislike ratio**, showing overall positive viewer sentiment.
